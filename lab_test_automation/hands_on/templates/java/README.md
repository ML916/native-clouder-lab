## Open using Visual Studio Code

File -> Open Folder -> Select the hands_on/templates/java folder.

Open the liftTest.java class found in hands_on/templates/java/src/test/java and run it.

## Open using Eclipse

Sorry, nobody uses Eclipse anymore... :) Feel free to update this README.md with the instructions for Eclipse if you have Eclipse installed and manage to open the project there.
