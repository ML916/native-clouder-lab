# Hands-on 004

## Rational

Often the first step is to build your application. This may be compiling, building, packaging etc. 

In this case we will throw together a containerised application and build it using Github Actions

## Pre-requisites

- create a github repository
- copy the contents of labs/lab_sdlc_pipeline/app to the root of your project
- commit and push to you repository 

## Testing Locally

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
docker ps
docker kill <CONTAINER ID>
```

## Create a workflow

- Create the file .github/workflows/build.yml
- Edit the file and perform the following:
  - Give the workflow a name (seen in UI) with `name: My workflow`
  - We want to run this every time we push the source to github so add `on: push` on Line 2
  - Lets define the list of jobs (just one so far) by adding the following code:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build Container Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Build Image
        run: docker build -t ${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest .
  ```

## Review your Workflow

The complete workflow should now look like

```yaml
name: Feature
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main

jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build Container Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Build Image
        run: docker build -t ${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest .
```

## Test Your Workflow

- Commit and push your changes
- Go to your project in Github.com
- Choose the actions tab
- What's happening? Did it work?
