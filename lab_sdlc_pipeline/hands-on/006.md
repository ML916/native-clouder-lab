# Hands-on 006

## Rational

We will borrow an action to scan the image we just built to ensure it has no vulnerabilities in the OS or dependencies.

## Pre-requisites

- [Hands-on-005](/labs/lab_sdlc_pipeline/hands-on/005.md)

## Extend the workflow

Add the following job to the workflow https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action

```yaml
image-scan:
  name: Image Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout Source
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: '${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest'
        format: 'table'
        exit-code: '1'
        ignore-unfixed: true
        vuln-type: 'os,library'
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

## Test Your Workflow

- Commit and push your changes
- Go to your project in Github.com
- Choose the actions tab
- It didn't work? Why not?
- How could we rectify that?

## Try something else 

- Move the `Run Trivy vulnerability scanner` step into the build job
- Push and Test
