# Hands-on 005

## Rational

Now we will add more tests and start to think about parameterisation, context and sequencing.

## Pre-requisites

- [Hands-on-004](/labs/lab_sdlc_pipeline/hands-on/004.md)

## Extend the workflow

- Edit your workflow that you worked on in the previous lab to look something like:
```yaml
name: Feature
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main

jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build Container Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Build Image
        run: docker build -t ${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest .

  unit-tests:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.unit-tests.outputs.unit-test-result }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        env:
          NAME: sean
        run: |
          echo "Unit Tests are running..."
          if [ "$NAME" = "sean" ]; then 
            echo "::set-output name=unit-test-result::PASS"
            echo "pass" && exit 0
          else
            echo "::set-output name=unit-test-result::FAIL"
            echo "fail" && exit 1
          fi

  collate-test-results:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: unit-tests
    steps:
      - name: Print Results
        run: echo "The result of the Unit Tests was ${{ needs.unit-tests.outputs.result }}"
```

## Review your Workflow

- What is an output?
```yaml
outputs:
  result: ${{ steps.unit-tests.outputs.unit-test-result }}
```
- What is an env? 
```yaml
env:
  NAME: sean
```
- What is needs?
```yaml
needs: unit-tests
````
## Test Your Workflow

- Commit and push your changes
- Go to your project in Github.com
- Choose the actions tab
- What's happening? Did it work?
